# React-and-Typescript---The-practical-guide


TypeScript is an amazing technology that helps developers write better code with less errors - simply because it let's you catch & fix type-related errors immediately whilst writing the code (instead of when testing the application).

This course will teach me how to use TypeScript with React - and, of course, the course will introduce me to all the core concepts & patterns that I need to work with components, state, side effects & more in a type-safe way!

This course will:

- Teach me WHY using TypeScript in my React projects might be a good idea
- Introduce me to the key TypeScript concepts I'll need - when working with React & in general
- Get me started with using TypeScript with React - for components, state & more
- Explore more advanced, complex patterns & examples
- Help me with building dynamic or even polymorphic components in a type-safe way
- Teach me how to use TypeScript with React's Context API
- Explore how I can enhance code used with useReducer() with help of TypeScript
- Cover data fetching & useEffect() with TypeScript

By the end of this course, I intend to get new TypeScript + React concepts to apply in my own (future) React projects and write better, more type-safe code.


What I'll learn from this course:
- Learn how to build React apps with TypeScript
- Get a structured introduction to TypeScript
- Use both basic & advanced TypeScript concepts
- Build dynamic & highly flexible components with React & TypeScript
- Build advanced & highly dynamic components in a type-safe way
- Use TypeScript with React's Context API & useReducer() Hook
- Manage state and events with React and TypeScript
- Use TypeScript with Redux for type-safe global state management
